# 🚅 IoT-Based Velocity Detection and Data Transmission System

An affordable and scalable IoT solution to detect and transmit the velocity of moving objects such as trains or vehicles. This system leverages Arduino Uno, IR sensors, LCD display, and GSM module to prevent accidents in railway and traffic environments.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional systems for monitoring vehicle or train speed are either manual or based on costly technologies like RADAR or LIDAR. These systems:
- Lack real-time data transmission.
- Are expensive to deploy widely.
- Often exclude IoT integration.

This project addresses these challenges by developing a **low-cost, IoT-enabled velocity detection and GSM-based data transmission system**.
